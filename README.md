# GLisp

GLisp is a really crappy lisp!  It will eventually be more and more like common lisp, as I have time and feel bored enough to work on a project I don't expect to be better than others (sblc, abcl, clisp, gcl, etc.).

just run `make` if you have gcc installed, it only uses the standard C libraries so far.
